When I decided my life needed a personal blog, I also decided that I wanted it to be as little of a hassle as humanly possible. I had read a little about static websites and thought that would work. I was also already using Caddy for another project so I wanted to reuse that. 

## Stack
After a short Google search I ended up with this stack:

**AWS EC2**  
Running this on an EC2 instance seemed like the easiest solution. I'd have full control of the setup and I could reuse my existing Caddy setup.

**Caddy**  
Caddy is awesome. By far the easiest setup I've ever used.

**Hugo**  
Hugo looked like a straight forward way to go. Flexible enough for when I wanted to get creative but also easy to use and lightweight.
